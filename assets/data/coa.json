Learning is not limited to the classroom; hence, different opportunities to learn are given:  field trips and alternative class programs. We promote education as a right and not a privilege, since people are more empowered when given equal opportunities. We advocate for awareness of the power of education not only for the children in our partner communities, but also to the Loyola Schools community.",

With the looming problems in our educational system, we reach out to the youth in the Marikina Heights Community and not just provide fun learning experiences, but encourage them to use their voice and take up space in society.",
